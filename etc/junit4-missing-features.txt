[ai generated overview of junit4 features]

*. injecting Random into test methods (based on the current context). Use non-synchronized
Random implementation. Optionally (parameter?) enable verifying that this Random is not shared
with other threads for reproducibility.

4. Shuffled test execution order and seed annotations
   - Test method execution order is randomized by default each run
   - @Seed on a class fixes the main seed, making execution fully deterministic
   - @Seeds / @Seed on a method pins a per-method seed for regression coverage
     while still running once with a fresh random seed

6. Repeating tests with @Repeat
   - @Repeat(iterations = N, useConstantSeed = true) reruns a test N times with
     the same seed (verifies determinism or checks if failure is consistent)
   - @Repeat(iterations = N, useConstantSeed = false) reruns with a new
     pseudo-random seed each time (measures failure frequency)

8. Timeouts
   - Standard JUnit @Test(timeout=N) is honoured
   - @Timeout(millis=N) annotation provides an explicit alternative
   - Termination sequence: Thread.interrupt() → Thread.stop() → zombie
     detection; all attempts are logged with stack traces

9. Thread-leak detection
   - Threads that escape a test's ThreadGroup boundary are killed and cause
     a test failure
   - Encourages explicit Thread.join() before a test method returns

10. Lingering threads and advanced thread-leak control
    - @ThreadLeakLingering(linger=N) waits up to N ms for stray threads to
      finish naturally (useful for Executor pools or other uncontrolled threads)
    - Additional annotations for fine-grained policy:
        @ThreadLeakScope  – suite vs. test scope
        @ThreadLeakAction – warn vs. fail
        @ThreadLeakZombies – ignore vs. fail on zombie threads

11. Nightly / scaled tests
    - @Nightly marks a test that only runs when nightly mode is active
      (-Dtests.nightly=true)
    - scaledRandomIntBetween() and multiplier() scale input sizes based on
      nightly vs. daily mode

14. Custom test-method providers
    - @TestMethodProviders({...}) substitutes the default (@Test-based) selector
    - Implement TestMethodProvider to pick methods by any criteria (e.g. name
      suffix convention)

2. RandomizedTest base class and RandomizedContext
   - Extend RandomizedTest for convenient access to a per-test Random instance
   - Access the context directly via RandomizedContext.current()

3. Randomized input generation
   - Utility methods on RandomizedTest: randomInt(), randomIntBetween(),
     randomBoolean(), randomFloat(), etc.
   - Encourages testing over a broad input domain rather than fixed values
